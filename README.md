**The Featured Project: Classification Script**



This repository contains a script that implements multiple classification algorithms, including:

  -  Random Forest Classifier
  - Cross-Validation
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
  - SVM with Grid Search for Hyperparameter Tuning

The goal is to compare model performance and enhance predictive accuracy using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

Dataset:
📊 1,599 wines with 12 features representing physicochemical properties.
🔍 Classified into high quality and low quality wines.

Application: Automated Wine Quality Assessment 🍷
Winemakers and quality control teams can use machine learning models like the ones in this project to:

- Predict Wine Quality – Instead of relying solely on human tasters, wineries can use physicochemical data (e.g., acidity, alcohol content) to classify wines as high or low quality.
- Optimize Production – By understanding which features contribute to high-quality wine, producers can adjust fermentation processes and ingredient proportions.
- Enhance Consumer Trust – Automated classification can help maintain consistent quality, ensuring customers get the best product.
-  Reduce Costs – Machine learning-based quality control minimizes the need for extensive manual testing, saving time and resources.

This project could be extended to other areas in the food and beverage industry where quality prediction is critical. 🚀
